The SQL LIKE Operator:

The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

* The percent sign % represents zero, one, or multiple characters
* The underscore sign _ represents one, single character

Syntax: 

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;

Example:

SELECT * FROM player
WHERE name LIKE "Rock";

For making the LIKE operator case-sensitive, you can use the "BINARY" keyword in MySQL or the "COLLATE" keyword in other database systems. 



Examples of Wildcards
The below table shows some examples on how wild card can be written and what do they mean:

Pattern            Meaning

'a%'	     Match strings that start with 'a'
'%a'	     Match strings with end with 'a'
'a%t'	     Match strings that contain the start with 'a' and end with 't'.
'%wow%'    	 Match strings that contain the substring 'wow' in them at any position.
'_wow%'	     Match strings that contain the substring 'wow' in them at the second position.
'_a%'	     Match strings that contain 'a' at the second position.
'a_ _%'	     Match strings that start with 'a and contain at least 2 more characters.



1) Starts With:

To return records that starts with a specific letter or phrase, add the % at the end of the letter or phrase.

Example
Return all customers that starts with 'RO':

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'RO%';


2)Ends With:

To return records that ends with a specific letter or phrase, add the % at the beginning of the letter or phrase.

Example
Return all customers that ends with 'a':

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a';

3)Contains:

To return records that contains a specific letter or phrase, add the % both before and after the letter or phrase.

Example
Return all customers that contains the phrase 'or'

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%';

4)Combine Wildcards:

Any wildcard, like % and _ , can be used in combination with other wildcards.

Example
Return all customers that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%';

5) Without Wildcard:

If no wildcard is specified, the phrase has to have an exact match to return a result.

Example
Return all customers from Spain:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country LIKE 'Spain';


6) The _ Wildcard:

The _ wildcard represents a single character.
It can be any character or number, but each _ represents one, and only one, character.
