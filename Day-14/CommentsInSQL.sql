SQL Comments:

Comments are used to explain sections of SQL statements, or to prevent execution of SQL statements.

Note: Comments are not supported in Microsoft Access databases!

Single Line Comments:

Single line comments start with --.

Any text between -- and the end of the line will be ignored (will not be executed).

Example:

SELECT * FROM Customers -- WHERE City='Berlin';



2) Multi-line Comments:

Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored.

The following example uses a multi-line comment as an explanation:

Example
/*Select all the columns
of all the records
in the Customers table:*/
SELECT * FROM Customers;
